# github-user-gists


# I built my app in React so first of all you need to run in Node terminal the "npm install" command
# to have access to the GitHub Gists API you have to create an auth token from your GitHub acount
# - go to Settings/Developer settings/Personal access tokens
# - copy your token in showInfo function as value of "auth" key
# - to start the app run in the terminal "npm start" command
# when you click on gist link, to have a better JSON file view, please install JSON Viewer
# you can now search the users / you can try with the user "lukas"
